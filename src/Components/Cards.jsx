                This project is an interactive hand-drawing application
                 that uses Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe for real-time
                  hand tracking. Users can draw on a virtual canvas by
                   moving their pointed index finger and reset the canvas with a
                    specific gesture (thumb and pinky pinch).

                This project was made for UOttahack 7. 
                  With a team of 4 developers, we created
                    an AI-powered study assistant that listens
                      to an explanation of a topic, then provides
                        feedback as well as a set of flashcards.

                This project was created to solve a problem of 
                  consistently timed WiFi issues on campus while I was playing League of Legends. 
                    Using Selenium and SQL, I webscraped 10,000+ datapoints to accurately 
                      predict when it was a "safe" time to play ranked.
